          I’m a passionate Software Developer who believes in simple living and creative problem-solving through technology.

My journey with computers began in school — typing LOGO commands to make a little turtle move sparked a lifelong fascination, from exploring GW-BASIC loops to diving deep into C programming and Bash scripting.

My journey eventually brought me to the .NET ecosystem, where I found my professional home. Since then, I’ve grown into a C#/.NET Developer. Over the years, I’ve expanded my horizons into Node.js, GraphQL, TypeScript, and Cloud Computing, continuously evolving with the ever-changing tech landscape.

As a Microsoft Azure Certified Professional, I’ve worked across Software Development, Support, Maintenance, Leadership, and Mentorship — helping teams design and deliver scalable, secure, and high-performing software solutions.

I specialize in designing and developing enterprise applications using .NET Core, C#, Blazor, Web API, ASP.NET Core, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka. I have a proven track record in leading cross-functional teams, implementing microservice architectures, and driving DevOps adoption across CI/CD pipelines. I am experienced in both Azure and AWS Cloud environments, focusing on writing clean, maintainable code and driving innovation through collaboration and continuous learning.

I believe great software isn’t just about code — it’s about teamwork, curiosity, and continuous improvement.
